### Prerequisites

This reporistory depends on the following:

* [node](https://nodejs.org) - NodeJS v11.8.0 (npm v6.9.0)
* [truffle](https://truffleframework.com) - Truffle Framework v5.0.13
* [Infura](https://infura.io) - Infura 

Packages should be pre-installed

Other requirements:

* [truffle-flattener](https://github.com/nomiclabs/truffle-flattener) - Truffle Flattener v1.3.0
* [EthLint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint) - EthLint (Solium) v1.2.4

All steps and environment is based on Ubuntu 18.04

### Installing

Install and preparing:

```
npm install
```

## Compiling

Install and preparing:

```
truffle compile (--all)
```

### Migrations

Before running truffle migrate

The following files are required:

```
vi ~/.keys/owner.key
chmod 600 ~/.keys/owner.key
```

Infura configuration

```
vi ~/.keys/infura.key
chmod 600 ~/.keys/infura.key
```

Alternatively edit `truffle-config.js` to remove references for files

### Testing

(TODO) Add unit tests code to repo

## Deployment

Smart contracts can be deployed via truffle, but verification process will be troublesome on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) because of multi-file contarcts (despite flattening)

As such its recommended to "flatten" the contracts using tuffle-flattner:

```
truffle-flattener ./contracts/iown/IownToken.sol > ./build/IownToken-flattended.sol
```

Then you can use `./build/IownToken-flattended.sol` on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) along with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io).
The same flattended file can then be used on etherscan verification process.

To generate constructor arguments (abi encoded), [HashEx](https://abi.hashex.org) can be used.
